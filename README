Getting Started
---------------
Start the server by running npm start.

Tasks
-----
1.The index.html is fetching an array of todos on loading. Update the Todos list with this data 
  in the format given. The checkbox should be ticked if the 'done' field is true.
2.Create a backend API endpoint to create a new todo when the form is submitted. The new todo can 
  be simply added to the in-memory array. There is no database. When the frontend is refreshed, the
  new todo should be visible. 
3.When the checkbox is checked/unchecked, update the 'done' field of the todo item in the backend 
  array.
4.Show the todos sorted by deadline (closest date first).
-------------
5.Can the table be updated on the frontend without refreshing?
6.What should be done to show only five tasks at a time?
